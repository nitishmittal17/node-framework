'Node Framework' is a new lightweight web framework for NodeJS inspired by [Spring](https://spring.io/). It provides features like IoC (Inversion of control), declarative programming with decorators (a.k.a. Annotations from Java), AOP (Aspect oriented programming), synchronous looking control flow (with async-await or generators) and many more which simplifies the development time and makes your projects maintainable. Developers familiar with Java/Spring web programming will have easy time using 'Framework'. Being built on top of [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) enables also developers familiar with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) or similar web frameworks to easily start using it. Let's try it now and see all this in action!
